# Hi ~ ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŽ¯ About me

I am Grady Liu, a full-stack Developer. </br>
I have 5+ full stack development experience.
I am happy to find out some technical stuff that I don't know.
That makes me more humble and active in learning.
I enjoy the process while I struggle with the new challenge.</br>
One of my favorite sayings is **"What you learn easily, you forget easily too.If you watch and struggle on your own you will master the technique better."**
